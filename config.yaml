## chain configurations
## set option: '--skip-chain' or '-s' to skip installing chain (cess-multibucket-admin install --skip-chain)
## if set option: --skip-chain, please set official chain in bucket[].chainWsUrl or others chain you know

  ## the name of chain node
  name: "cess"
  ## the port of chain node
  port: 30336
  ## listen rpc service at port 9944
